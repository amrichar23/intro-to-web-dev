<div class="content"> Located in Cunningham County, New Jersey, Camp Crystal Lake was established by the Christy family in 1935.
  After being closed for a brief time due to an accidental drowning and the unsolved homocides of the original owners, Steve Christy hoped to reopen the camp in 1979.
  However, the reopening of Camp Crystal Lake was sabotaged by a Ms. Pamela Vorhees.
   Though the residents of Crystal Lake have been terrorized by the sheer number of murders that have occurred in ther small town over the last few decades,
we decided to open the camp back up to the public for some good, old-fashioned, family fun!
