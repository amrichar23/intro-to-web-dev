<h1>HELLO</h1></div>
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
    <br><br>
    <p class="lead">I am Amanda Richardson! Originally from New Jersey, I know reside in Lancaster County with my husband, daughter, two dogs, and four frogs. I am
    <br>currently studying social work at Millersville University. Upon graduating, I plan to pursue a master's degree, with a focus on mental health and drama.
  <br>After that, I plan to become certified in Expressive Arts Therapy, with the hopes of using drama therapy techniques in my practice. Theatre has always
  <br>been a huge force in my life. I truly believe that access to performing arts provides a safe environment to explore one's emotions and identity. Drama
  <br>therapy is increasing in popularity and has been show to be an effective intervention when working with various populations of all ages. I hope to bring
  <br>my theatre experience along with me into my professional career, to provide the best course of treatment for my future clients.
  <br><br> It has always been a dream of mine to start a nonprofit organization that brings theatre to individuals living with developmental disabilities. My goal is
  <br>to offer year-round, week long theatre camps for all ages! I believe that my social work background in expressive arts therapy will allow me to provide
  <br>a really enriching program to the community. Check back for updates!
  <br><br>For more information on my experience on and off the stage, I invite you to check out the Experience tab.</p><br><br><br>
