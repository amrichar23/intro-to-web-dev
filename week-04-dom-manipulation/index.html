      <div>Give me a <u>verb</u> ending in <b>"ing"</b>: <input id="verb-one-input"/></div>

      <div>Now, another <u>adjective</u>: <input id="adjective-two-input"/></div>

      <div>What was your <u>plural noun from above</u> again?: <input id="noun-two-input"/></div>

      <br><br>It was a <span id="adjective-one-output"></span> day in FairyTale Town.

      The three little <span id="noun-one-output"></span> had finally had enough of each other,
      it was time to build their own houses.

     <span id="verb-one-output"></span> in the woods was the <span id="adjective-two-output"></span>, old wolf.

     Noticing the <span id="noun-two-output"></span> struggling to complete their builds, he came up with a genuis idea.

     It was literally just to <span id="help-output"></span> them. Rude of you to assume anything differently.
